# Overview

This is me learning about Visual Studio Code, Github, and Python. Where I am learning to use them together to strenghten my skills in computer programming. 

I wanted to start small and make a tutorial on a simple basic humble beginnings of Hello world. 

I created this software to brush off some dust on my python skills. 

I made a little tutorial, first one ever actually, hopefully you like it. Its tiny.
